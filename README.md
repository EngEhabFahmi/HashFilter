need block process with its file's hash ? you can  use  this WFP library , to do it 
just call User-Mode C++ functions it will do it in Kernel-Mode

1. block TCP/UDP/ICMP based  on process file  hash
2. use SHA1 for hashing 
3. Log process Network Activity ( process hash , network info : remote and local port-ip address ) 
4. real time rule setting 
5. rule can act as white or  black list
